Community Team will only focus on the forum/website and game problems. Balance Team will be in charge of balancing the game, helping to create characters, and new skills. Quest Team will be in charge of creating storylines, quest missions, and helping me with new game ideas. Each of these teams will have group supervisors who over look everything and than give the final result to the webmasters to review (Ninetailschris and Nelo).
