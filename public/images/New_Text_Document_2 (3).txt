Hello.

- The game's name can be easily changed to something that fits the theme of dragon ball.
- The games engine can be easily re-used to make another type of game.
- The game can easily be transfered into a mobile game with out much funding.
- The game is player friendly. You can learn how to play with just a few games, and just incase theres a 
game manual to explain how the game works.
- The game itself is already done and playable. We have everything completed in terms of how the game works, 
game effects, graphics and its an online multiplayer competitive game. Note that the graphics can easily be 
changed to better suit the theme of the anime.
- We have a dragonverse, a game-created social platform where all players are able to connect and interact 
with each other before battling in the game.
- Updating is fairly cheap. It doesnt costs much to update the game effects, skills, characters and other 
potential ideas and they can be done in a fairly short time.
- The game's primary source of income is within its capsule corp. The Capsule Corp is where players use zenny 
to purchase ingame items, characters, and other assets. With your partnership we can easily add in premium
features that would benefit not only the indivual with premium goods, but also budokai online because of micro 
transactions that can be reinvested into the game to make it better overall.
- Explain how the game exploits/takes advantage of latest technology, such as the features of the canvas system,
html, javascript, w/e else.
- Explain why you made the game, what plans you intended for it and where you would like to see it in the future.
- Explain how you changed the game from its testing stages to how complex it is now, via images, code, and gameplay.
- Explain how the concept is done, but the game can be cleaned up better with hired artists.
- We take feedback from our playerbase. We accept ideas to make it better, and like to see
what other people have to say about the game and its features.
